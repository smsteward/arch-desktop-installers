This repository contains my shell scripts for installing the major Linux desktop environments on Arch Linux or Arch-based derivatives (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda, etc). Most of these scripts are modified versions of the scripts written by Ermanno Ferrari to suit my personal setup preferences. Ermanno is an amazing Linux content creator on Youtube at [EF - Linux Made Simple](https://www.youtube.com/c/EFLinuxMadeSimple) as well as an Arch Linux enthusiast, and I encourage everyone reading this to go check out his [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/eflinux) to view my inspiration for these scripts and to show your support.
